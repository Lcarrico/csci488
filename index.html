    This page is going to be holding my assignments for my <i>CSCI 488</i> class.
    This class is on Database Driven Web Applications and Software Engineering principles. Since this is not a web design class, this page is not meant to be super stylih or fancy, but instead include server-side programming and database.

    My assignments will probably go somewhere here.
